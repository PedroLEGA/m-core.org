<p>MAGI aims at efforts in part in achieving the decentralization. This means that coins have to be distributed over a broad audience during a significant amount of duration. mPoW is designed with difficulty dependent mining reward for mPoW blocks in order to put network hashrate under a certain limit. This operation lessens miners, and enable mining being available to general users. Similarly, modifications to the regular PoS principle (aka PPC's PoS) leads to mPoS, designed to reject potential attacks through accumulating a large amount of coins or offline staking time.</p>

<p>mPoW, the magi's proof-of-work (PoW) protocol, in addition to required computational works to be done to deter denial of service attacks, is also a network-dependent rewarding model system. The mPoW rewards participants who solve complicated cryptographical questions not only to validate transactions but also to create new blocks and generate coins. The amount of coins generated are constantly monitored by the mPoW protocol and tuned on the basis of an attraction-repulsion model: 1) incremental rewarding to stimulate network activities during passive mining phase, and 2) decremental rewarding to mitigate redundant mining sources during agressive mining phase. mPoW can effectively govern the magi's network and limit it under a certain scale, enabling the general devices to be capable of mining magi. ++ For details - <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.7948" class="black-color">A network-dependent rewarding system: proof-of-mining</a>.</p>

<div class="block_table text-font-14px">
<p>mPoS, the magi's proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol, aims to achieve distributed consensus through operations in addition to mPoW. mPoS is designed such that it rejects potential attacks through accumulating a large amount of coins or offline staking time, either of which leads to security concerns. Similar to mPoW's operation, mPoS is constructed in accordance with the concept of the attraction-repulsion model. Magi hybridizes mPoW with mPoS, and integrate both consensus approaches in order to acquire benefits from the two mechanisms and create a more robust payment system.</p>
