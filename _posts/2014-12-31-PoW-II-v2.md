<p>Huge amount of energies consumed in the cryptocurrency has been a big issue, which is totally opposite to the global efforts in saving energies. This issue should be resolved sooner or later in order to advance the cryptocurrency any further. As one of the possible solutions, that's the reason we have PoS. However, the pure PoS mode would never lead to decentralization. Any approaches are vain if decentralization cannot be maintained. The PoW should be remained in order to distribute coins into a broad audience over time. </p>

<p>The basic rule of dealing with the energy concern is to involve a "braking" mechanism in coin design. Such a rule exists in every piece of things in nature: why earth/electrons should circle the sun/nucleus without collapsing or departure? or just imagine a vehicle without brakes. This in general belongs to the attraction-repulsion model. </p>

<p><u>What do we need to save energy?</u></p>

<p>On the whole, mining should be encouraged at a lower hashrate level. </p>

<p>The issue to be solved in this upgrade is the removal of the vague dependence of block rewards on the difficulty, due to the fluctuating nature of block time. A basic consideration is applying a filter to smooth out the difficulty data. Details are as follows. </p>

<p><u>Necessary to adjust miner efficiency?</u></p>

<p>A consequence of the above implementation is the well-shaped block rewards in which big rewards due to network fluctuation are totally avoided. The following figures disclose the real situation most likely: </p>

<p>Mining at a network hashrate of 22 Mh/s results in 50 XMG/block, whilst hashrate increases to 36 Mh/s like mining the air. </p>

<p><u>Who shall mine nothing?</u></p>

<p>Provided that I have a miner with hash rate of 1000 kh/s; I would have big concern of yielding nothing at its full speed, but I don't care throwing 10kh/s at nothing. The reality behind this scene will be a different story; at the time by which the exit of miners will pull the block reward back to some numbers, one is able to mine something by then. Reducing hash rate does sound the right action in this case. </p>

<p>Attenuating hashrate of miners in mining bitcoins is very unusual or pointless, since the higher the hash rate, the greater the bitcoin amount mined. Except this sole "advantage", there are dozens of facts people should be aware of that increasing hash rate comes along the wrong direction: 

<ol>
<li>Running a PC miner is totally incompetent since every single person in the world would like to sharpen their miners with high hashrate; </li>
<li>Running 100% CPU usage miners is impractical in most of situations even if one can do so; </li>
<li>Mobile devices are incompetent in this scene. </li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>It will be beneficial to run a hashrate-depressed miner under the improved MagiReward system. Technically by doing so it's possible to run miners everywhere. </p>
