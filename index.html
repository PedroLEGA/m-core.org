    <p class="about-text">Coin MAGI is a digital payment solution. MAGI is decentralized and running constantly without downtime and the need of interference by intermediary, authorities and censorship. People can make payments using MAGI to anyone in the world freely. In the meantime, anyone can issue MAGI coins through their personal devices, and software-based mining or minting processes. MAGI is implemented utilizing the proof-of-work and proof-of-stake protocols. MAGI puts efforts on removing the competitive nature of mining, and particularly focuses on fairness, cost effective and energy efficiency when issuing coins and maintaining the public ledger and the blockchain system. <a href="/resources" class="black-color">Read More &raquo;</a></p>
