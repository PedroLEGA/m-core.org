        <p class="lead">Coin MAGI is a digital payment solution. MAGI is decentralized and running constantly without downtime and the need of interference by intermediary, authorities and censorship. People can make payments using MAGI to anyone in the world freely. In the meantime, anyone can issue MAGI coins through their personal computers and a software-based minting process.</p>
